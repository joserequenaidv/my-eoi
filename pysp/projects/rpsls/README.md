# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard and Spock :gem: :page_facing_up: :scissors: :lizard: :alien:  
This is my 2nd project for the Libraries module of the [Python Specialization Course](https://github.com/joserequenaidv/my-eoi/blob/master/pysp/README.md).

## Project Journal
### Introduction
This is the game called Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard and Spock. You can access to the raw code [here](main.py).

**The rules are the following:**
- :scissors: Scissors cuts :page_facing_up: paper
- :page_facing_up: Paper covers :gem: rock
- :gem: Rock crushes :lizard: lizard
- :lizard: Lizard poisons :alien: Spock
- :alien: Spock smashes :scissors: scissors
- :scissors: Scissors decapitates :lizard: lizard
- :lizard: Lizard eats :page_facing_up: paper
- :page_facing_up: Paper disproves :alien: Spock
- :alien: Spock vaporizes :gem: rock
- :gem: Rock crushes :scissors: scissors

### List of Tasks
**We need to follow several steps**
- First version:
    - Get the player's choice
    - Get the cpu's choice
    - Create the logic and apply the rules

### Troubleshooting the Project
**First version of the project:**
- An input to get the player's choice
- random.randint(1,5) to get the cpu's choice
- Seventeen conditionals to apply the rules
- What if there is a draw? 
    - Add loop

### Acquired Skills
- Master basic conditionals and the random module

### What's next
- Make a more elegant code
- Add score
- Test more random methods *(randrange(), shuffle(), choices(), among others)*
- Design a visual game and deploy it on [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)
- Make a desktop app of the game
