# Weekly Script of Backup
This is my 1st project for the Libraries module of the [Python Specialization Course](https://github.com/joserequenaidv/my-eoi/blob/master/pysp/README.md).

## Project Journal
### Introduction
The project consists of making a backup script that weekly saves different types of files in a zip.

### List of Tasks
**We need to follow several steps:**
- Go across all the files of a given path
- Select the files with the extensions we'd like to save
- Save the file as a compressed extension format
- Name that zip file differently depending on the day it is
- Create a folder for each month

### Troubleshooting the Problems
Firstly, we need to know what libraries would be necessary to address our tasks.
**Regarding to Juan Ignacio's advice, we can choose some of the following:**
- os / sys
- zipfile / gzip / zlib
- time / datetime / arrow

Also we could use the library *shutil* and some others.
