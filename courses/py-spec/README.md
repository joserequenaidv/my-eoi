# Specialization in Python

This is the Python Specialization Course funded by the Spain's School for Industrial Organization and given by the Python Canarias organization. 

## Friendly statement
The content of this course was fully in Spanish, therefore some of the links above will be in that language. Even though in my repository I try to translate as much as I can, there are some files that are not completely translated.

Any feedback in code, English grammar, organization, tidiness or any ways of improvement are more than welcome!
