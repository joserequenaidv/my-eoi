##Courses
- SP. Specialisation in Python

##Branches
Every course has a branch for itself. The content of these branches will be up to date and merged with the master branch, but not necessarily erased. 

###List of branches:
    - master: It is in charge of the updates in the main directory related to the content of the README file, the images and the guidelines of how to dive through this repository.
   
##Icons
The icons I use in all my documents and commits are in the complete list of GitHub emoji markup :relaxed:.

List: 

- Directories:
    - :snake: - Specialisation in Python.

- Subdirectories:
    - :aerial_tramway: - Renowned libraries.
    - :abc: - Language grammar and foundation.

- Activities:
    - :notebook: - README updates.
    - :art: - Design and style updates.
    - :black_nib: - Content updates. 
    - :penci12: - Correcting mistakes.

**The way I name my commits follows a simple logic:**
- Directory + Subdirectory + Activity
- If the changes are in the main directory, just the activity will be mentioned.
