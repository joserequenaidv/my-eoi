## Courses

## Branches
Every course has a branch for itself. The content of these branches will be up to date and merged with the master branch, but not necessarily erased. 

### List of branches:
    Â· master: It is in charge of the updates in the main directory related to the content of the README file, the images and the guidelines of how to dive through this repository.

## Icons
The icons I use in all my documents and commits are found in [the complete list of GitHub emoji markup](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908).
